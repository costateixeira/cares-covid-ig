  <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="intro"> </a>


  <p>This Implementation Guide contains the specifications for COVID19 case reporting. This is a reference specification to the <a href="https://openhie.github.io/case-reporting/index.html" target="_blank">base case reporting specification</a>.</p>

  <p>
    There is a need for countries to centralize and report on COVID19 data that is captured at the point of service systems by effectively monitoring and measuring individuals diagnosed with the disease and their status towards being up-to-date vaccinated. 
    The COVID19 <a href="vaccination_status.html">vacination status</a> of <em><strong>Up-to-date Vaccinated</strong></em> refers to those individuals who have been fully vaccinated (received all doses for the Primary Vaccine Series) and received all doses for the specified Booster Vaccine Series.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a content specific FHIR IG that has been derived from the <a href="https://www.notion.so/gicsandbox/09ee19ee4fd34649a8cc07e1c171a84e?v=85d824b3ef9943ba92cb4204f6532ccf" target="_blank">COVID19 Minimum Dataset</a>.

  <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>  <a name="ip"> </a>
  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide may include examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
