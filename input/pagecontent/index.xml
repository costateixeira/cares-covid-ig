    There is a need for countries to centralize and report on data that is captured at the point of service systems to effectively measure and monitor the progression and outcome of the COVID19 pandemic by measuring and monitoring individuals diagnosed with the disease and their status towards being up-to-date vaccinated. The COVID19 immunisation status of <em>Up-to-date Vaccinated</em> refers to those clients who have been fully vaccinated (received all doses for the Primary Vaccine Series) and received all doses for the specified Booster Vaccine Series.
