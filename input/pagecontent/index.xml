  <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="Introduction"> </a>
	<p/>

<p>There is a need for countries to centralize and report on data that is captured at the point of service systems to effectively measure and monitor the progression and outcome of the COVID19 pandemic by measuring and monitoring individuals diagnosed with the disease and their status towards being up-to-date vaccinated.
The COVID19 immunisation status of <em>Up-to-date Vaccinated</em> refers to those clients who have been fully vaccinated (received all doses for the Primary Vaccine Series) and received all doses for the specified Booster Vaccine Series.
This is a content specific FHIR IG that has been tailored to support the <a href="https://www.notion.so/gicsandbox/09ee19ee4fd34649a8cc07e1c171a84e?v=85d824b3ef9943ba92cb4204f6532ccf">COVID19 Minimum Dataset (MDS)</a>.</p>

	<h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
	<p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
